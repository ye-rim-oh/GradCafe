# 2020-2026 GradCafe Political Science PhD Yearly Comprehensive Trend Analysis Report

**Report Date**: 2026-02-24

**Data Source**: GradCafe 2020-2026 data re-scraped using a unified parser format

**Total Sample**: **5,002** cases (Fall PhD admission results from 2020 to 2026)

> Note: To address the lack of structured nationality/subfield data in historical records (2020-2025), all data from 2020 to 2026 was newly scraped on February 24, 2026, using the exact same structural parser originally built for 2026.

_\* Accept Rate = Accepted / (Accepted + Rejected)._

- **Key Findings**: Across almost all years, **American** applicants consistently experience a higher acceptance rate than **International** applicants.
- The gap in acceptance rates varies by year, ranging from approximately 10%p difference up to an extreme of 20%p.
- 'Unknown' status ratios were higher in the past (2020~2021) but have decreased in recent years as the badge system became more active.

## 3. Subfield Analysis

### 3.1. Reported Volume by Subfield per Year

| Year | AP  | CP  | IR  | Methods | Public Law/Policy | Theory | Unknown | Psych/Behavior |

### 3.2. Acceptance Rate by Subfield (Major Subfields Only)

| Year | AP    | CP    | IR    | Methods | Public Law/Policy | Theory |
| ---: | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| 2020 | 83.3% | 74.4% | 73.3% | 75.0%   | 100.0%            | 64.3%  |

_\* Accept Rate = Accepted / (Accepted + Rejected)._

- **Interpretation Note**: Because the 'Unknown' ratio is generally high, this sub-sample may not perfectly represent the true applicant pool.
- Among identified subfields, Comparative Politics (CP) and International Relations (IR) account for the largest share every year.

### 3.3. Cross-Tabulation: Subfield by Nationality (2026 Focus)

| 2020 | Rejected | 107   | 160.9 | 108   | 158.5 | 105    | 4.68   |
| 2021 | Accepted | 42    | 165.6 | 42    | 163.1 | 41     | 5.12   |
| 2021 | Rejected | 74    | 163.6 | 74    | 160.4 | 73     | 4.90   |

| 2023 | Accepted | 58    | 163.6 | 59    | 164.3 | 54     | 4.80   |
| 2023 | Rejected | 60    | 162.9 | 62    | 162.8 | 55     | 4.74   |
| 2024 | Accepted | 46    | 163.7 | 47    | 163.4 | 41     | 4.85   |
| 2024 | Rejected | 50    | 162.7 | 52    | 161.8 | 46     | 4.75   |
| 2025 | Accepted | 29    | 163.1 | 25    | 163.0 | 26     | 4.70   |

| 2026 | Accepted | 76    | 164.6 | 68    | 165.1 | 65     | 4.69   |
| 2026 | Rejected | 133   | 163.2 | 124   | 166.3 | 113    | 4.59   |

- GRE scores are voluntarily submitted, meaning substantial sample bias is present.
- AW (Analytical Writing) scores were harder to parse in earlier years, but with the recent introduction of the formatting badges, data collection has improved.
- While the score averages haven't drastically changed, there is a distinct downward trend in the frequency of applicants reporting their scores.

- **First Acc (Initial Acceptances)**: The timing of the very first acceptances has slowly shifted earlier—from late January/early February to early-to-mid January.
- **Median Final (Median Decision Date)**: Regardless of early decisions, the median date where the bulk of decisions hit remains highly consistent around February 10th to 15th every year.

- This metric shows what percentage of the total yearly decisions were released by a specific date.
- Generally, between 50~80% of final decisions are shared by February 15th. Notably, the 2026 cycle shows an extremely fast release pace very early in the season.

- **February** is overwhelmingly the peak month for critical decisions across all historical seasons.
- The lack of data from March onward in 2026 is due to the scraping occurring in mid/late-February.

### Key Takeaways Summary

1. **Overall Acceptance Rate Decline**: After peaking around 44% during the 2022/2024 cycles, the acceptance rate has dropped back down to the 35% range, showing a trend of intensified competition.
2. **Structural Nationality Divide**: Every year without exception, American applicants maintain a relative advantage in acceptance rates, typically outperforming International applicants by a 10-20%p margin.
3. **Decreasing GRE Reporting**: Although raw GRE averages have not drastically changed, the frequency of voluntarily reporting scores has consistently decreased year-over-year.
4. **Timeline Solidification**: Even though the "first" release date fluctuates slightly, the absolute peak where the majority of decisions are concluded consistently lands in **early-to-mid February (Feb 10th - Feb 15th)**.
5. **2026 Data Cautions**: The record-high sample volume and historically low acceptance rate must be weighed against the fact that the season is still "in progress" (missing late March/April waves and Waitlist conversions).

## Fall 2026 Admission Cycle Specific Highlights

- **Record Sample Size & Increased Competition**: Even though data was collected only through mid-February, the cycle logged 962 posts—the highest volume in the last 6 years. With an overall acceptance rate of 35.3%, it suggests a notably more competitive season than previous years.
- **Plummeting International Acceptance Rate**: The acceptance rate for international students plummeted to 28.2%, a sharp decline compared to previous years (which averaged ~38%). The gap between American (45.3%) and International applicants is the largest on record.
- **Unusually High Release Pace**: As of February 15, the cumulative completion rate reached an astonishing 80.1%. When compared to historical averages (55-65%) at the same point, this season exhibits an unprecedented "speed admissions" trend.
- **Future Indicators**: Because late-cycle decisions and Waitlist movements have not yet been factored in, there remains potential for a marginal recovery in aggregate metrics as the cycle concludes.

## Notes and Caveats

- Due to changes in the GradCafe UI over the years, historical data (2020-2025) was scraped again using the exact same parser rules implemented for the latest 2026 script. This ensures perfect structural consistency across all 7 years.
- 'Unknown' data points represent samples where the applicant omitted their major or nationality badge.
- The 2026 cycle records indicate an in-progress partial dataset depending on the execution date of the scrape; future trends may evolve.
- University names underwent institutional normalization processing. To ensure statistical integrity, all volume and acceptance rate (ratio) calculations intentionally exclude 'Waitlist' and 'Interview' outcomes from the denominator.
